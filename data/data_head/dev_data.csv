1089071,429474,va death benefits contact number,"VA Burial Benefits Burial Allowances Burial, Headstone & Plot Rate Table (2015 - 2016)SERVICE CONNECTED BURIAL *$2,000 NON-SERVICE CONNECTED BURIAL (Veteran dies while hospitalized by VA) *$722.58 NON-SERVICE CONNECTED VETERANS (Indigent or Veterans not hospitalized by VA) *$309.68 STATE CEMETERY *$722.58 PLOT ALLOWANCE *$722.58Note 3: The PL 111-275 allows increase from $309.68 to $722.58 for Veterans who die while properly hospitalized by VA. For nonservice-connected burial for indigent or Veterans not properly hospitalized by VA, the burial reimbursement remains $309.68. The increases from $309.68 to $722.58 will apply to deaths occurring on or after October 1, 2011. The first opportunity for an annual increase (i.e., cost-of-living adjustment) is October 1, 2012. What Are VA Burial Allowances? VA burial allowances are partial reimbursements of an eligible veteran's burial and funeral costs. When the cause of death is not service-related, the reimbursements are generally described as two payments: (1) a burial and funeral expense allowance, and (2) a plot interment allowance. Who Is Eligible ? You may be eligible for a VA burial allowance if:• you paid for a veteran's burial or funeral AND • you have not been reimbursed by another government agency or some other source, such as the deceased veteran's employer and • the veteran was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. In addition, at least one of the following conditions must be met:• the veteran died because of a service-related disability or • the veteran was receiving VA pension or compensation at the time of death or • the veteran was entitled to receive VA pension or compensation, but decided not to reduce his/her military retirement or disability pay or • the veteran died in a VA hospital, in a nursing home under VA contract, or while in an approved state nursing home. How Much Does VA Pay? Service-Related Death. VA will pay up to $2,000 toward burial expenses for deaths on or after September 11, 2001. If the veteran is buried in a VA national cemetery, some or all of the cost of transporting the deceased may be reimbursed. Nonservice-Related Death. VA will pay up to $309.68 toward burial and funeral expenses, and a $722.58 plot-interment allowance for deaths on or after October 1, 2011. If the death happened while the veteran was in a VA hospital or under VA contracted nursing home care, some or all of the costs for transporting the deceased’s remains may be reimbursed. The plot allowance may be paid to the state for the cost of a plot or interment in a state-owned cemetery reserved solely for Veteran burials if the Veteran is buried without charge. Burial expenses paid by the deceased’s employer or a state agency will not be reimbursed. Burial and Memorial benefits Eligibility 1. Veterans discharged from active duty under conditions other than dishonorable and 2. service members who die while on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training, as well as 3. spouses and dependent children of Veterans and active duty servicemembers,may be eligible for VA burial and memorial benefits. The Veteran does not have to die before a spouse or dependent child for them to be eligible. With certain exceptions, active duty service beginning after Sept. 7, 1980, as an enlisted person, and after Oct. 16, 1981, as an officer, must be for a minimum of 24 consecutive months or the full period of active duty (as in the case of reservists or National Guard members called to active duty for a limited duration). Active duty for training, by itself, while serving in the reserves or National Guard, is not sufficient to confer eligibility. Reservists and National Guard members, as well as their spouses and dependent children, are eligible if they were entitled to retired pay at the time of death, or would have been upon reaching requisite age. See Chapter 8 for more information. VA’s National Cemetery Scheduling Office or local national cemetery directors verify eligibility for burial. A copy of the Veteran’s discharge document that specifies the period (s) of active duty and character of discharge is usually sufficient to determine eligibility. In some instances, a copy of the deceased’s death certificate and proof of relationship to the Veteran (for eligible family members) may be required. Under Section 2411 of Title 38 of the United States Code, certain otherwise eligible individuals found to have committed federal or state capital crimes are barred from burial or memorialization in a VA national cemetery, and from receipt of government-furnished headstones, markers, medallions, burial flags, and Presidential Memorial Certificates. Veterans and other claimants for VA burial benefits have the right to appeal decisions made by VA regarding eligibility for national cemetery burial or other memorial benefits. Burial in VA National Cemeteries Burial in a VA national cemetery is available for eligible Veterans, their spouses and dependents at no cost to the family and includes the gravesite, grave-liner, opening and closing of the grave, a headstone or marker, and perpetual care as part of a national shrine. For Veterans, benefits also include a burial flag (with case for active duty) and military funeral honors. Family members and other loved ones of deceased Veterans may request Presidential Memorial Certificates. VA operates 131 national cemeteries, of which 72 are open for new casketed interments and 18 are open to accept only cremated remains. Burial options are limited to those available at a specific cemetery but may include in-ground casket, or interment of cremated remains in a columbarium, in ground or in a scatter garden. Contact the national cemetery directly, or visit our Web site at: www.cem.va.gov to determine if a particular cemetery is open for new burials, and which other options are available. The funeral director or the next of kin makes interment arrangements by contacting the National Cemetery Scheduling Office or, in some cases, the national cemetery in which burial is desired. VA normally does not conduct burials on weekends. Gravesites cannot be reserved; however, VA will honor reservations made under previous programs. Surviving spouses of Veterans who died on or after Jan. 1, 2000, do not lose eligibility for burial in a national cemetery if they remarry. Burial of dependent children is limited to unmarried children under 21 years of age, or under 23 years of age if a full-time student at an approved educational institution. Unmarried adult children who become physically or mentally disabled and incapable of self-support before age 21, or age 23 if a full-time student, also are eligible for burial. Burial in Arlington National Cemetery Arlington National Cemetery is a national cemetery administered by the Department of the Army. The primary mission of Arlington National Cemetery is to serve as the final resting place for the men and women who honorably served in the Armed Forces and their immediate family members. The cemetery routinely performs 20 to 30 funeral services each day. Certain Eligible Parents for VA Burial A new federal law passed in 2010 (Public Law 111-275) extends burial benefits to certain parents of servicemembers who die as a result of hostile activity or from training-related injuries who are buried in a national cemetery in a gravesite with available space. The biological or adopted parents of a servicemember who died in combat or while performing training in preparation for a combat mission, who leaves no surviving spouse or dependent child, may be buried with the deceased servicemember if the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines that there is available space. The law applies to servicemembers who died on or after Oct. 7, 2001 and to parents who died on or after Oct. 13, 2010. Headstones, Markers and Medallions Veterans, active duty service members, and retired Reservists and National Guard service members, are eligible for an inscribed headstone or marker for their grave at any cemetery – national, State Veterans, or private. VA will deliver a headstone or marker at no cost, anywhere in the world. For eligible Veterans whose deaths occurred on or after Nov. 1, 1990, VA may provide a government headstone or marker even if the grave is already marked with a private one, or VA may provide a medallion instead of a headstone or marker for Veterans’ graves in private cemeteries when the grave is already marked with a privately-purchased headstone or marker. Spouses and dependent children are eligible for a government headstone or marker only if they are buried in a national or State Veterans cemetery. Flat markers are available in bronze, granite or marble. Upright headstones come in granite or marble. In national cemeteries, the style provided will be consistent with existing monuments at the place of burial. Niche markers are available to mark columbaria used for inurnment of cremated remains. Medallions are made of bronze and are available in three sizes: 5-inch, 3-inch, and 1 ½-inches. Headstones, markers and medallions previously provided by the government may be replaced at the government’s expense if badly deteriorated, illegible, vandalized or stolen. To check the status of a claim for a headstone or marker for placement in a national or State Veterans cemetery, call the cemetery. To check the status of one being placed in a private cemetery, call 1-800-697-6947. Inscription Headstones and markers must be inscribed with the name of the deceased, branch of service, and year of birth and death. They also may be inscribed with other optional information, including an authorized emblem of belief and, space permitting, additional text including military rank; war service such as “World War II;” complete dates of birth and death; military awards; military organizations; civilian or Veteran affiliations; and personalized words of endearment. Private Cemeteries To submit a claim for a headstone, marker or medallion for a private cemetery, mail a completed VA Form 40-1330 (available at www4.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA40-1330.pdf), Application for Standard Government Headstone or Marker, and a copy of the Veteran’s military discharge document to Memorial Programs Service (41A1), Department of Veterans Affairs, 5109 Russell Rd., Quantico, VA 22134-3903. The form and supporting documents may also be faxed toll free to 1-800-455-7143. Before ordering, check with the cemetery to ensure that the Government-furnished headstone or marker will be accepted. All installation fees are the responsibility of the applicant.“In Memory Of” Markers VA provides memorial headstones and markers with “In Memory Of” as the first line of inscription, to memorialize those whose remains have not been recovered or identified, were buried at sea, donated to science or cremated and scattered. Eligibility is the same as for regular headstones and markers. There is no fee when the “In Memory Of” marker is placed in a national cemetery. All installation fees at private cemeteries are the responsibility of the applicant. Medallions in Lieu of Government Headstone/Marker Public Law 110-157 enacted December 26, 2007, expanded VA authority to provide a medallion instead of a headstone or marker for Veterans’ graves in private cemeteries when the grave is already marked with a privately-purchased headstone or marker. Claimants will have the option to apply for either a traditional headstone or marker to place on the grave, or a medallion to affix to a privately-purchased headstone or marker. VA anticipates the medallion will be available during 2010. Current information regarding medallion availability is located at www.cem.va.gov. Presidential Memorial Certificates These are issued upon request to recognize the United States military service of honorably discharged deceased Veterans. Next of kin, relatives and other loved ones may apply for a certificate by mailing, e-mailing, or faxing a completed and signed VA Form 40-0247 along with a copy of the Veteran’s military discharge documents or proof of honorable military service. The form and eligibility requirements can be found at www.cem.va.gov. All requests must be sent with supporting military documents or proof of honorable military service. Burial Flag A United States flag is provided, at no cost, to drape the casket or accompany the urn of a deceased veteran who served honorably in the U. S. Armed Forces. It is furnished to honor the memory of a veteran's military service to his or her country. VA will furnish a burial flag for memorialization for each other than dishonorable discharged• veteran who served during wartime • veteran who died on active duty after May 27, 1941 • veteran who served after January 31, 1955 • peacetime veteran who was discharged or released before June 27, 1950 • certain persons who served in the organized military forces of the Commonwealth of the Philippines while in service of the U. S Armed forces and who died on or after April 25, 1951 • certain former members of the Selected Reserves Generally, the flag is given to the next-of-kin, as a keepsake, after its use during the funeral service. When there is no next-of-kin, VA will furnish the flag to a friend making request for it. For those VA national cemeteries with an Avenue of Flags, families of veterans buried in these national cemeteries may donate the burial flags of their loved ones to be flown on patriotic holidays. You may apply for the flag by completing VA Form 21-2008, Application for United States Flag for Burial Purposes. You may get a flag at any VA regional office or U. S. Post Office. Generally, the funeral director will help you obtain the flag. The law allows us to issue one flag for a veteran's funeral. We cannot replace it if it is lost, destroyed, or stolen. However, some veterans' organizations or other community groups may be able to help you get another flag. The proper way to display the flag depends upon whether the casket is open or closed. VA Form 21-2008 does provide the correct method for displaying and folding the flag. The burial flag is not suitable for outside display because of its size and fabric. It is made of cotton and can easily be damaged by weather. Military Funeral Honors Upon request, Do D will provide military funeral honors consisting of folding and presentation of the United States flag and the playing of “Taps.” A funeral honors detail consists of two or more uniformed members of the armed forces, with at least one member from the deceased’s branch of service. Family members should inform their funeral director if they want military funeral honors. Do D maintains a toll-free number (1-877-MIL-HONR) for use by funeral directors only to request honors. VA can help arrange honors for burials at VA national cemeteries. Veterans service organizations or volunteer groups may help provide honors. For more information, visit www.militaryfuneralhonors.osd.mil. Veterans Cemeteries Administered by Other Agencies Arlington National Cemetery Administered by the Department of the Army. Eligibility is more restrictive than at VA national cemeteries. For information, call (703) 607-8000, write Superintendent, Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, VA 22211, or visit www.arlingtoncemetery.mil. Department of the Interior Administers two active national cemeteries – Andersonville National Cemetery in Georgia and Andrew Johnson National Cemetery in Tennessee. Eligibility is similar to VA national cemeteries. State Veterans Cemeteries Seventy-nine State Veterans cemeteries offer burial options for Veterans and their families. These cemeteries have similar eligibility requirements but many require state residency. Some services, particularly for family members, may require a fee.

Families of Veterans buried in national cemeteries with an avenue of flags may donate the burial flags of their loved ones to be flown on patriotic holidays. You may apply for the flag by completing VA Form 27-2008, Application for United States Flag for Burial Purposes. VA Burial Allowances: Effective July 7, 2014, VA changed its monetary burial benefits regulations to simplify the program and pay eligible Survivors more quickly and efficiently. These regulations will authorize VA to pay, without a written application, most eligible surviving Spouses basic monetary burial benefits at the maximum amount authorized in law through automated systems rather than reimbursing them for actual costs incurred. The new burial regulations will permit VA to pay, at a flat rate, burial and plot or interment allowances thereby enabling VA to automate payment of burial benefits to most eligible surviving Spouses and more efficiently process other burial benefit claims. The burial allowance for a non-service-connected death is $300, and $2,000 for a death connected to military service. You may be eligible for a VA burial allowance if: You paid for a Veteran's burial or funeral, ANDYou have not been reimbursed by another government agency or some other source, such as the deceased Veteran's employer, ANDThe Veteran was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable, ANDThe Veteran died because of a service-related disability, ORThe Veteran was receiving VA pension or compensation at the time of death, ORThe Veteran was entitled to receive VA pension or compensation, but decided not to reduce his/her military retirement or disability pay, ORThe Veteran died while hospitalized by VA, or while receiving care under VA contract at a non-VA facility, ORThe Veteran died while traveling under proper authorization and at VA expense to or from a specified place for the purpose of examination, treatment, or care, ORThe Veteran had an original or reopened claim pending at the time of death and has been found entitled to compensation or pension from a date prior to the date or death, ORThe Veteran died on or after October 9, 1996, while a patient at a VA-approved state nursing home. What the VA will pay: Service-Related Death: If the Veteran died on or after September 1, 2001, the maximum service-connected burial allowance is $2,000. If the Veteran died before September 11, 2001, the maximum service-connected burial allowance is $1,500. If the Veteran is buried in a VA national cemetery, VA may reimburse some or all of the costs of transporting the deceased Veteran's remains. Non-service-Related Death: If the Veteran died on or after October 1, 2015, VA will pay a $300 burial allowance and $747 for a plot. If the Veteran died on or after October 1, 2014, but before October 1, 2015, VA will pay $300 for burial allowance and $745 for a plot. If the Veteran died on or after October 1, 2013, but before October 1, 2014, VA will pay $300 burial allowance and $734 for a plot.
