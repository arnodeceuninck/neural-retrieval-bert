Have you heard of SARMS a.k.a. Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators? It’s dubbed as a steroid alternative that’s said to be the most efficient for cycling steroids and PCT (post cycle therapy). Today, I’ll talk about SARMS and give you the 401 to help give you a glimpse on everything there is to know about it. What are SARMs? The topic of SARMs (or selective androgen receptor modulators) have been a controversial one since the early 90s when they were first introduced in mainstream science. Now this isn’t to say that SARMs haven’t been around long before this period. In the 1940s, steroidal SARMs have been used for medical use in multiple diseases including cancer, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, and a number of other diseases that affect muscle and bone wasting. These SARMs had a very strong effect on muscle building due to its “high affinity”, which in non-scientific terms means it’s attraction to a receptor is high and that is what makes a chemical reaction in the body more powerful. Unfortunately, steroidal SARMs came with side effects such as estrogen conversion causing gynecomastia (puffy sensitive nipples in men), decreased libido, and damage to the liver and kidneys (related to its methylation). Another side effect was that steroids can change the DNA of multiple cells such as the prostate and heart cause them to enlarge. Steroidal VS Non Steroidal SARMs In the early 1990s, scientist created a non-steroidal version of these SARMs by making them protein based. The difference between these two types of SARMs is most easily described as a lock and key system. The cells in the body act as locks and the binding sites of the cells are like key holes. Steroidal SARMs have the ability to act like a master key unlocking every cell to promote protein synthesis and growth, even in cells you don’t want to “unlock”. Nonsteroidal SARMs are designed specifically for one type of lock, therefore, it will only affect areas of the DNA that prevent muscle and bone wastage while also promoting growth in these areas. Nonsteroidal SARMs have been used for bodybuilding, powerlifting and a multitude of other sports since the start of it popularity. Their benefit to side effect ratio have been tested since the 1990s with no evidence suggesting harm. This breakthrough in scientific technology continues to suggest SARMs is the future of anabolics and will eventually replace steroid therapy. Now this is not to say that nonsteroidal SARMs are the answers to all our problems. Although a protein based SARMs have very limited side effects with large benefits for strength and muscle gains, they also require a much longer period of use and cannot yet compare to the effectiveness of a steroid. The comparison of benefits and unwanted side effects have been researched for decades. Unlike testosterone cypionate, SARMS are more than 200 times more powerful in muscle stimulation and 80 times more selective for muscle. SARMS vs. Prohormones Prohormones were the first ones introduced to the market. However, steroids or testosterone supplements don’t have the muscle growth effects of authentic steroids and they carry the same adverse side effects making them unsafe for human use. Meanwhile, SARMS are an upgrade of anabolic steroids. It can be administered orally, minimizing the effects in testosterone blood levels. SARMS are also believed to cure various diseases which steroids and other medicines treated earlier. It also shows promise to replace androgen which can yield similar desirable results on muscle tissue as steroids. According to a study conducted by the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA), approximately tenth of the worlds athletic population uses SARMS (particularly Ostarine) to enhance their body and performance (which is considered a safe performance boost). Studies have shown the ability of SARMs to increase muscle and bone mass dramatically in animals while having no adverse impact on the prostate. Phase I trials of SARMs in humans have also reported significant increases in lean muscle mass. The two most talked about SARMs among bodybuilders are SARM S-4 a.k.a. Acetamidoxolutamide and SARM S-1: a.k.a. Ostarine or MK 2866. How Do SARMS Work? As we age, our endurance, power and skeletal muscle mass deteriorates due to the loss of type 2 muscle fibers. This hinders individuals to function normally. With SARMS, skeletal muscle mass and strength in androgen-deficient people can be enhanced. There are 2 types of administering SARMS – orally or in injectable dosages. The anabolic effect is expected to be the same as testosterone. Moreover, it’s also said to produce dose-dependent improvements in bone mineral density and motorized strength apart from the ability to decrease body fat and increase lean body mass. SARMS link to the same receptors that old steroids such as Dianabol and testosterone would connect to, but minus the drawbacks and side effects of traditional steroids and prohormones. This is a fresh start in the advancement of muscle pharmacology as SARMS can help enhance muscle mass, while helping you reduce body fat and boost athletic performance beyond your imagination. The Most Popular SARMSThere are many SARMS, but here are the 4 main SARMS that are currently offered and most applicable to athletes, bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts: LGD-4033 – a potent, non-steroidal bodybuilding supplement for enhancing lean muscle mass and reducing body fat Ostarine (MK-2866) – selective for anabolic activity at certain ARs, great for maintaining and increasing lean body mass and recomping S4 (Andarine) – selective for bone tissue (mostly low virilization), aimed to cure osteoporosis and won’t produce the development of prostate and other secondary sexual organs RAD140 – this is probably one of the most exciting SARMs, as well as the most current. In fact, aside from the muscle building effects seems to look like a possible cure for Alzheimer. Other compounds like GW 501516 (Cardarine) considered the kind of endurance supplements and SR9009 are usually grouped with SARMs, but are not the same. The Benefits of SARMSSARMS is believed to have the capacity to employ the benefits of anabolic supplements while reducing the side effects of steroids. Non-toxic (won’t cause liver damage)Avoids bone loss (direct action of testosterone in bone thru the AR-mediated conduit is critical for its anabolic effects in bone)Decreases the threat of prostate problems in men without muscle mass loss Won’t impede your HPTASimilar effects with testosterone No estrogen and Dihydrotestosterone (a hydrogen hormone) conversion For muscle builders, taking SARMS will give: Muscle loss prevention (during cutting period)Lean muscle development Improved strength Faster injury recovery Joint healing abilities PCT use following anabolics Let’s a took at a few of these benefits in more detail…Increased muscle strength In the Asian Journal of Andrology, subjects increased muscle strength 20x more than those in the placebo group. Subjects continued to gain strength and size in muscle tissue for up to 5 months but with significant decreases in effectiveness after the 3rd month (Dalton et al, 2014). Increased muscle size Deductive evidence has proven a significant increase in muscle tissue hypertrophy (growth of muscle tissue). Inductive evidence suggests subjects will gain between 3 to 15 lbs of muscle tissue over the a 12 week period (Dubois et al, 2015). The amount of muscle hypertrophy is dependent on diet, training, and the characteristics of the SARM. Mild SARMs such as MK2866 will range much lower in hypertrophy than more potent SARMs such as RAD140 or LGD4033. Tissue selectivity According to the Oxford Academic journal of Endocrinology, nonsteroidal SARMs have been designed to attach itself to area of the DNA responsible for skeletal muscle protein synthesis. Unlike other anabolic agents, non steroidal SARMs do not affect any other tissues in the body (Dubois et al, 2015). Inhibits cancer cell division In an unrelated study to muscle growth performed by the Public Library of Science’s (PLOS) Peer Reviewed Open Access Journal, nonsteroidal SARMs have been studied for its effects on breast cancer. Androgen receptors are known to play a pivotal role in the treatment of breast cancer and due to the inability for nonsteroidal SARMs to convert to estrogen, there is a very narrow probability for negative repercussions. The results have not only confirmed that tumor cells decrease in weight by 90%, but it may even inhibit the potential for breast cancer development (Dalton et al, 2014). Regulation of libido Recent studies have indicated healthy increases in sexual desire in both men and women with the use of nonsteroidal SARMs. The males with hypogonadism, testosterone therapy is a common practice. In testosterone therapy there are many side effects that result is severe consequences for the user, such as thickening of the blood (commonly causing strokes and heart attacks), enlargement or development of cancer on the prostate, and gynecomastia (characterized as the development of female breast on men) due to an overproduction of estrogen. A 2014 article published by the Asian Journal of Andrology stated “SARM’s beneficial pharmacology and desirable pharmacokinetics offer considerable promise in the treatment of late onset hypogonadism. The convenience of once daily oral therapy combined with defined safety margins surrounding a proven efficacious dosage form may one day challenge testosterone replacement therapy as the gold standard in treating late onset hypogonadism” (Dalton et al, 2014). In the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Researcher reported positive effects of nonsteroidal SARMs on females with low sexual motivation indicating noticeable increases in sexual desire (Jones et al, 2010). Safety and tolerability In the Oxford Journal of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences, the popular nonsteroidal SARM LGD 4033 (Ligandrol) has been recently studied for it’s effectiveness and safety in healthy young men. Results were favorable indicated by hormone and lipid levels returning to normal without the use of a post cycle therapy. No dangers were detected throughout the study. although there was noticeable suppression in testosterone and HDL cholesterol, it was not significant enough to cause adverse reactions. Because LGD 4033 is considered one of the strongest and most potent nonsteroidal SARMs available, it is not likely that less potent SARMs will produce any harmful effects (Bhasin, 2010). Side Effects of SARMSWhat’s great about SARMS is that its side effects are minimal, so you don’t have to worry about any negative effects. If you overdo it, however, some people may experience shut down or even gynecomastia if currently predisposed to it. Be responsible, and in 99.9% of cases users will not have any side effects from the use of SARMs. Current research has so far agreed with that conclusion. Where to Buy Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators Online There are many manufacturers selling SARMs online right now. Although they are not legal for human consumption, you can buy them from many research labs to experiment with your rat. There are multiple companies selling SARMs online, and the only place I’ve been going to has been the company Innovative Research Chemicals. In fact, as of January 8th 2018 of this year, their popularity all over reddit and solid reputation caused them to upgrade to a bigger facility. You can check out their homepage for a selection of SARMs and other useful compounds. Stacking Your SARMs: Your Best Options When it comes to SARMs, many people stack more than 1 at a time to maximize their results even further. Since in most cases you won’t experience any side effects using SARMs, you can safely stack multiple compounds and do a total recomp of your physique. KONG is a 5 SARM compound available at Powersupps UKFor the best stack right now, I highly recommend you check out a product called KONG by Medfit Nutrition. This is a capsule containing 5 different SARMs in one. It’s probably the strongest SARM product we’ve seen online right now. Popular stacks for SARMs include: LGD 4033 + MK 677GW 501516 + MK 2866SR 9009 + S23Liquid SARMs are harder to stack because of the pure taste and inconvenience of having to measure it out multiple times a day. Plus it tends to be much more expensive. That’s why capsules are your best bet for stacking, while liquids are best for taking one SARM at a time. SARMs: Our Final Review With SARMS showing great promise for selective high anabolic muscle activity and in preventing muscle wasting and age related illnesses without the negative side effects associated with anabolic steroids and prohormones, SARMS could be the next big thing. The IOC (International Olympic Committee) is even preparing for the use of SARMS with Olympic athletes. It’s Anabolics 3.0 and the “Universal Soldier Formula” of the future!What are your thoughts on SARMS? Feel free to leave a comment below. FAQsa Do you need a PCT after using SARMs?

2, androgen receptor define,"The Hormones : Androgens Construction and Production Revving Up Effects Androgen Disrupters Research History References Say the word androgen and most people think male. Indeed, they are dubbed the male hormones mainly because males make and use more testosterone and other androgens than females. These steroid hormones confer masculinity by triggering and controlling body programs that govern male sexual development and physique. In females, androgens play more subtle roles. CAPTION: Testosterone is a potent androgen. (click image for 3-D interactive animation) CREDIT: Chem IDPlus, National Library of Medicine Construction and Production Androgens are a group of chemically related sex steroid hormones. Steroids are a special kind of fat molecule with a four-ringed, carbon atom backbone or core, like their cholesterol predecessor. CAPTION: A series of chemical changes turns cholesterol into androgen hormones. CREDIT: Tulane/Xavier Center for Bioenvironmental Research. A series of chemical reactions spurred by proteins called enzymes remove and add groups to cholesterol's polycyclic (many-ringed) core. These actions transform cholesterol first into the steroid pregnenolone, then into testosterone and other androgens. In humans and other vertebrates, androgens are made primarily in the male testes, female ovaries, and adrenal glands. Kinds and potencies vary among animal groups. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (17-beta-hydroxy-5-alpha-androstan-3-one) are the most potent androgens in humans and four-legged vertebrates. The weaker androgens androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) occur in small amounts in all vertebrates. Although 11-ketotestosterone is a weak androgen in four-legged vertebrates, it is the most potent variety in bony fishes and sharks.back to top Revving Up Like all steroid hormones, androgens produce effects by docking with receptors on the cell's membrane surface or inside the cell in the liquid cytoplasm. Receptor binding triggers different chemical signaling systems depending on receptor location. CAPTION: Androgen receptor binding. (click image for animation) CREDIT: Tulane/Xavier Center for Bioenvironmental Research. A steroid hormone uniting with a surface receptor starts a lightening-fast chemical relay in the cytoplasm that changes cell chemistry and initiates hormone release, blocks cell death, or nudges the cell from the resting to growth phase of its life cycle. In contrast, when steroid hormones go inside a cell, they can unite with a receptor to form a hormone/receptor unit that moves into the nucleus, attaches directly to special DNA binding sites, and activates protein-producing genes. The proteins drive the cell changes guiding androgen-controlled growth and development (Cato et al. 2002).back to top Effects Androgens control male sex traits and development and influence female sexual behavior. Hormones and genetics together guide gender and sexual features in the developing vertebrate embryo. In humans, the Y chromosome first determines the sex as male. Other animals also have sex chromosomes, but in some fish and reptiles, the physical environment, especially temperature of the embryo, is more important for determining male sex. After male sex is determined, androgens orchestrate growth and development of the male reproductive system, including the penis, testes, prostate, sperm, and other essential features. Later in life, the hormones trigger male puberty, influencing vocals (bird songs, amphibian calls, human's deep voice), body ornamentation (human facial hair, bird feather color, fish skin color), muscle mass, and behaviors such as sex drive and aggressiveness. Androgens also influence female sex drive.back to top Androgen Disrupters Some compounds in the environment can chemically neuter animals by blocking androgens' effects. These antiandrogens block production of androgen hormones or clog receptors, keeping true androgens out. A group of industrial chemicals known as phthalates can reduce testosterone production in fetal testes causing sex-organ defects and loss of reproductive functions in animals (Gray et al. 1999; Thompson et al. 2004). Limited research suggests these chemicals, found in personal care products and most soft plastics, may affect human genital development in similar ways. Phthalates are associated with several subtle, yet potentially serious, genital changes in baby boys whose mothers, when pregnant, had elevated levels of the chemicals in their urine. The boys' shortened anus to penis distance, incomplete testes descent, and smaller scrotum and penis may forewarn of infertility or cancer later in life (Swan et al. 2005). Animal studies confirm the fungicides vinclozolin and procymidone, the herbicide linuron, and the DDT-insecticide breakdown product p,p'-DDE block androgen receptors and hinder development and function of the penis, testes, epididymis, and other masculine structures in male offspring (Gray et al. 2001). click here to read more about sources...back to top Research History Scientists have studied androgens since the 18th century. John Hunter initially described androgenic actions in 1771. He transplanted a rooster’s testes into a hen and found she grew rooster-like combs and wattles. In 1849, A. A. Berthold transplanted testes from a normal rooster into a castrated rooster. The castrated rooster regained his combs and wattles, his crowing voice, and his fighting behavior (Hadley 2000). Almost a century later, in 1935, Leopold Ruzicka worked out the chemical structure of the ""androgenic principle"" from the testes, calling it testosterone (Hadley 2000).back to top References Cato A, Nestl A, and Mink S. 2002.

The immunocytochemical analysis of parrots' testicular tissues provides an insight into their reproductive system but is often hampered by the lack of reliable antibodies. In the present study, we tested a large panel of antibodies raised against steroid receptors, steroidogenic enzymes, relaxin peptides including their receptors, and proliferation markers on paraffin sections of testicular tissue from eight psittacine genera representing three continents. All investigated species displayed the tested markers in somatic and germ cells of testis and epididymis, even though cell distribution was partly heterogenous and in species-specific patterns. The 17β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase-2, 3β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase, and smooth muscle actin allowed the cross-species differentiation between active and nonactive gonads. The remaining steroidogenic enzymes, steroid receptors, relaxin peptides, and Ki67 proved to be suitable to define reproductive activity depending on the parrot species. Adapting immunocytochemical methods to different psittacines was successful, though various cellular expression patterns do not allow the transfer of results among different parrot species. However, the availability of a reliable repertory of sexual markers is important to examine reproductive biology of psittacine birds. Keywords Immunocytochemistry Testes Psittaciformes Steroidogenesis Relaxin family Proliferation1. Introduction According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature [1] and Birdlife International [2], more than 130 out of approximately 370 living parrot species are listed as near-threatened or worse. In addition to numerous projects targeting the conservation of wild parrots, breeding programs of psittacine birds in captivity are maintained to increase their respective populations. Irrespective of various factors like constricted genetic diversity and difficult pair bonding, the success of these projects also depends on substantiated knowledge about psittacine procreation. Our previous study concentrated on the immunocytochemical detection of steroid-producing cells within the testis and epididymis in conjunction with gonadal histology—a reliable method to ascertain the actual reproductive status of male budgerigars (Buds) ( Melopsittacus undulatus) [3]. We were able to provide valuable information about local steroidogenesis in male psittacine gonads. Nevertheless, additional special markers are required for these birds to provide a more thorough documentation describing gonadal function and hormonal control by initially demonstrating the local synthesis of various reproductive factors. This is fundamental for the peripheral detection of these factors in psittacine blood or feces, a less invasive method for fertility assessment compared with endoscopy or testicular biopsy. Numerous immunocytochemical markers successfully used for the characterization of the mammalian reproductive tract are not established in avian species; especially psittacines are still scarcely investigated, e.g., the steroidogenic enzyme P450 aromatase represents mainly a marker for mammalian Leydig cells but also (subject to species and reproductive stage) for Sertoli, germ, and epididymal cells [4]. The only immunocytochemical demonstration in gonads of the rooster [5] requires a comparison with the localization of the enzyme in other avian species. The role of aromatase in the parrot’s testes, in correlation with the previous detection of estrogen receptor (ERα) in spermatocytes [3], has still to be clarified. Different isoenzymes of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) were isolated in reproductive tissues of various mammal species [6–8]. Considering the avian situation, quail [9] and starling [10] brain and chicken ovary [11] displayed 17β-HSD expression. Whereas the first report about the upregulation of 17β-HSD type 2 in Sertoli cells of Buds [3] supports the thesis of androgen biosynthesis in avian Sertoli cells, the role of other 17β-HSD isoenzymes in the psittacine male tract remains unexplained. The distribution of the relaxin (RLN) family peptides and their receptors in cells and tissues of the mammalian male tract is well-studied [12]; RLN represents a marker for Sertoli cells [13] and in combination with the RLN family peptide receptor (RXFP) 1 for Leydig cells [14]. Relaxin-like factor (RLF) and RXFP2 are basically expressed in mammalian Leydig cells [15]. References to the RLN peptides in aves are limited to the chicken ovary [16], testis [17,18], and the pigeon crop sac [19]. Morphological changes in the testes and the epididymides occur because of proliferation and apoptosis during reproductive activity and inactivity. Proliferation processes in the avian male tract were demonstrated in galliform Sertoli cells [20] and in psittacine germ cells [3]. Within the scope of mitotic activity of somatic and germ cell types, the situation in other parrot species requires more investigation. This also applies to the expression of contractile cytoskeletal proteins, especially the microfilament smooth muscle actin (SMA) found in the testicular tissues of galliform and anseriform birds [21–23]. Its function in psittacine male reproduction continues to remain a matter of interest. The present study focused on two special objectives; first, to evaluate a spectrum of reproductive markers for the Bud as a model species for endangered Psittaciformes and second, to test the transferability of these established methods to other psittacine species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Animals and tissue preparation For the detection of reliable markers to evaluate the reproductive status, testis samples of different psittacine species were examined. Budgerigars ( Melopsittacus undulatus, N = 45) and cockatoos (Coc; Cacatuidae; N = 12, including the genera Nymphicus, Eolophus and Cacatua) were chosen as representatives for Australian species. The Congo African gray parrot (AGP, Psittacus erithacus erithacus, N = 6) was selected as Old World species and Amazon parrots (AP; genus Amazona, N = 6) and macaws (N = 6, including the genera Ara and Cyanopsitta) likewise as representatives of the New World species. Tissue samples were collected within the scope of routine necropsies at the Clinic for Birds and Reptiles in Leipzig. The experimental procedure of sample retrieving, tissue preparation and histochemical staining was performed as explicitly described in our previous publication [3].2.2. Histological characterization of the reproductive status Using the Axioskop 2 mot plus with magnification ×400 and the pictorial documentation system Axio Vision (Axio Vs 40 V 4.5.0.0, Carl Zeiss Imaging Solutions, Jena, Germany), the hematoxylin and eosin-stained gonadal samples were assigned to three different reproductive phases; nonactive, intermediate, and active stage. The criteria for the definition of a nonactive, intermediate, and active status were the quantity of germ cells (spermatids and spermatozoa) plus the interstitial and seminiferous tubular dimensions. The distance measurement of seminiferous tubules and interstitium in micrometers was conducted by scaling 10 fields of view per slide with magnification ×200. Furthermore, the presence of melanin in the gonadal tissue was reported to examine a potential relation between testicular melanogenesis, seasonal changes in testicular morphology, and endocrine control of the gonads.2.3. Immunocytochemistry The immunocytochemical analyses were conducted by adhering to the established protocol [3]. To demask the nuclear markers (androgen receptor ( [AR]-1, AR-2), ERα, and progesterone receptor [PR]), the slides were pretreated in citrate buffer (p H 6.0) at 120 °C using a steamer. The incubation with 0.0125% trypsin solution at 37 °C for 15 minutes and the endogenous peroxidase inhibition with 3% hydrogen peroxide was followed by staining the sections with a 2% alcoholic solution of Sudan black B (Sigma Aldrich Chemie, Deisenhofen, Germany) for 20 minutes. Because Sudan black B colors phospholipids, neutral fats, and sterols dark blue to black [24], this step was designed to mask an unspecific reaction of lipid accumulation in the seminiferous tubules (described in Reitemeier et al. 2011 [3]) with the primary antibody. To avoid nonspecific binding of the primary antibody, the tissue samples were incubated with pigeon plasma (1:100 dilution of Aqua bidest). Subsequently, the slides were reacted with the specific antibody (all specifities, dilutions, clone names, and providers are listed in Table 1) at room temperature for 2 hours. Washing in PBS was followed by incubation with Dako En Vision+ Dual Link System Peroxidase (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA, USA) for 45 minutes. The enzyme activity was visualized using the chromogenic substrate 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol (AEC) (AEC Substrate Kit for Peroxidase, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Finally, the tissue sections were covered with Immu-Mount (Thermo-Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Table 1.

Sherwood (Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA); H, Antibodies-online (Aachen, Germany); I, Dako Cytomation (Carpinteria, CA, USA). The detection of cytoplasmic steroidogenic enzymes (3β-HSD, 17β-HSD type 1, 2, and 7), RLN family members (Relaxin, Relaxin-like-factor, RXFP-1, and RXFP-2), and SMA was performed similarly as for the nuclear markers, except for the heat pretreatment. Additionally, the visualization of the enzyme with AEC was followed by a counterstaining with Mayer's hematoxylin. A slightly different method was used for the localization of aromatase. After an overnight reaction with primary antibody (see Table 1) at 4 °C, the slides were incubated with secondary antibody (polyclonal horse anti-mouse/rabbit Ig G; H+L Biotin, Vector Laboratories) at room temperature for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the visualization was carried out using alkaline phosphatase standard (AK-5000; Vector Laboratories) and the chromogen Histo Red (AP-Substrate Kit; Linaris, Wertheim-Bettingen, Germany). The double-indirect method for obtaining proliferation marker Ki67 (based on Scholzen et al. [40]) was previously specified [3]. Psittacine kidney, adrenal, ovary, and oviduct (steroid receptors, steroidogenic enzymes, and RLN family markers) and mice tumors (proliferation markers) were used as positive control tissue. The omission of the primary antibody and the incubation with Ig G antibodies of irrelevant specificity served as negative controls. The immunocytochemistry was interpreted using a light microscope (Axioskop 2 mot plus) with magnification ×100, ×200, and ×400. The distribution of all tested markers in the testicular and epididymal tissues was recorded.2.4. Statistical analysis The results of the interstitial and seminiferous tubular measurement are presented in terms of mean values ± SEM and statistically compared using the Mann-Whitney U Test. The level of significance was defined at P ≤ 0.05 (investigated via IBM SPSS Statistics 20).2.5. Ethics All psittacine tissues used for this study were obtained within the scope of routine necropsies at the Clinic for Birds and Reptiles. The birds either deceased or were euthanized because of various diseases, which did not affect the reproductive tract. No birds were sacrificed only for the purpose of this study. All study protocols were arranged and permitted according to the German law on animal experimentation.3. Results3.1. Histological analysis3.1.1. Seminiferous tubules and testicular interstitium The quantity of germ cells (spermatids and spermatozoa) was similar to the results determined for the Bud [3], so detailed data are not considered at this point. We reported significant variations (P values in Table 2) in tubular and interstitial dimensions between the three reproductive states of the Bud. In the other investigated species (Cocs, AGPs, macaws, and APs) the tubular dimensions also declined from active to nonactive status whereas the interstitial diameters did the opposite (see Table 2 ). Only the Cocs displayed significant dimension differences in tubules of intermediate versus active stage (P = 0.024) and in interstitium of nonactive versus intermediate stage (P = 0.024). Both the largest testicular tubules (192.4 ± 43.5 μm) in the active and the largest interstitium (23.6 ± 5.7 μm) in the nonactive status were presented by the Coc. The nonactive macaw's tubular (49.3 ± 10.1 μm) and the active AGPs interstitial (2.8 ± 0.7 μm) dimensions were the smallest observed. Table 2.

Interstitial melanin Melanin was observed in testicular interstitium and tunica albuginea of Cocs (nonactive and intermediate stage), but only distributed in form of pigment-containing cells or melanocytes in the genera Eolophus and Cacatua. The testes of genus Nymphicus (intermediate and active stage) displayed no melanin. The Cocs, however, showed that the degree of melanin accumulation was higher in nonactive than in intermediate stage ( Fig. 1 A, B ). One nonactive macaw ( Ara ararauna) also exhibited black to brown pigmented cells in the interstitium, but to a lesser degree than in the Cocs' testes. The absence or presence of melanin in the tunica albuginea was also visible macroscopically, because only the testes of genus Eolophus and Cacatua appeared brown to black, the remaining ones white-yellowish. No melanin was detectable in the gonads of the other parrot species. Download high-res image (2MB) Download full-size image Fig. 1.

Steroid receptors3.2.1.1. Androgen receptor The steroid receptor AR-2 was undetectable in all species throughout all reproductive stages. Concerning the AR-1, intermediate and active macaws merely displayed positive testicular capsules. Nonactive macaws did not express the receptor. Apart from that, all species presented AR–1-positive germ cells independent of their sexual status. Remarkably, only the Coc showed no positive Leydig cell staining throughout all stages and its nonactive testis expressed AR-1 in Sertoli cells. Androgen receptor–1-positive efferent ductal epithelium (ciliated and nonciliated cells) and interductal connective tissue cells were detected in epididymides of active and intermediate Buds, Amazon, and African gray parrots (the latter also in the nonactive stage).3.2.1.2. Estrogen receptor The ERα was presented by germ cells of every species in all three phases. Leydig and epididymal cells were ERα-positive depending on species and reproductive status. Only nonactive Cocs, Buds, and APs displayed ERα-expressing Sertoli cells.3.2.1.3. Progesterone receptor Apart from nonactive macaws and APs, in which no positive staining for PR was noticed, all species showed PR-positive germ cells ( Fig. 1 C) in all reproductive stages. Intermediate Cocs and nonactive Buds and African gray parrots presented PR in Sertoli cells. Progesterone receptor-positive Leydig cells were merely observed in active Cocs and nonactive AGPs. The Bud was the only species in which PR was detected in epididymal epithelium and interductal connective tissue cells throughout all reproductive phases.3.2.2. Steroidogenic enzymes3.2.2.1. Aromatase The steroidogenic enzyme aromatase was present in germ cells ( Fig. 1 D) and epididymal epithelium of every species in all sexual states (except no positive germ cells in nonactive AGPs). Whereas macaws displayed aromatase-expressing Sertoli cells in all stages, no positive staining was detected in Sertoli cells of APs. The visualization of the enzyme was successful in Leydig cells of almost every species and reproductive stage, with only intermediate and nonactive Cocs and active macaws exhibiting negative ones. All species expressed aromatase in epididymal tissue throughout all reproductive states, most of them in epididymal epithelium and in interductal connective tissue—with the exception of the Coc, which presented only aromatase-positive interductal connective tissue in all three stages.3.2.2.2. 3β-HSDThe active and intermediate testis samples of every parrot species revealed 3β-HSD in Leydig cells and epididymal epithelium, and additionally in the nonactive ones of AGPs. Conspicuously, all nonactive gonads (except AGPs) displayed no reaction on the enzyme. Only active and intermediate macaws expressed 3β-HSD in Sertoli cells. Apart from the Coc, all active and intermediate species presented germ cells positive for 3β-HSD.3.2.2.3. 17β-HSD-1Irrespective of the fact that 17β-HSD-1 was not detectable in active Cocs and nonactive macaws and APs, all species displayed this enzyme in epididymal epithelium, independent of the reproductive status. The AGP was the only species with positive reactions in Sertoli and Leydig cells throughout all reproductive states. Intermediate and active AGPs, macaws, APs, and Buds showed 17β-HSD-1 in germ cells. On the contrary, we observed 17β-HSD-1-positive germ cells in intermediate and nonactive Cocs ( Fig. 1 E, F).3.2.2.4. 17β-HSD-2All nonactive testes were negative for 17β-HSD-2 ( Fig. 1 G), whereas all active and intermediate species expressed the enzyme in Sertoli ( Fig. 1 H, I) and epididymal epithelial cells. Only active Cocs showed an additional staining in germ cells and interductal connective tissue cells.3.2.2.5. 17β-HSD-7Nonactive Buds were negative for 17β-HSD-7. However, all species displayed enzyme-positive germ cells (except nonactive macaws and active APs) and Leydig cells in every reproductive status ( Fig. 1 J, L).3.2.3. Relaxin family3.2.3.1. Relaxin receptor RXFP1The RLN receptor RXFP1 was not expressed in nonactive APs, whereas other species of this reproductive status demonstrated positive germ ( Fig. 1 M), Sertoli, and Leydig cells and epididymal cells (for species-specific differences, see Table 3 ). On the contrary, all active and intermediate stages showed a cross-species staining of germ and efferent duct epithelial cells ( Fig. 1 N, O). Considering every species on its own, a different expression of RXFP1 was remarkable in intermediate and active stages versus the nonactive stage. For example, nonactive APs did not express the receptor at all, and active and intermediate ones displayed RXFP1 in somatic, germ, and epididymal cells. The same cellular distribution was demonstrated by Cocs of intermediate and active stage, whereas RXFP1-positive germ cells only occurred in the nonactive stage.3.2.3.2. Relaxin A comparable phenomenon was verifiable for RLN in macaws ( Fig. 2 A) and APs. Positive Sertoli cells were detected in active and intermediate macaws, whereas no staining occurred in nonactive ones. Amazon parrots of active and intermediate stage demonstrated positive germ and epididymal cells, whereas RLN was not verifiable at all in the nonactive stage. Cockatoos, AGPs, and Buds did not show such noticeable varieties of RLN expression between the reproductive states. Download high-res image (1MB) Download full-size image Fig. 2.

Relaxin receptor RXFP2Concerning the main receptor for RLF, RXFP2, all active and intermediate phases were dominated by positive Leydig and efferent duct epithelial cells ( Fig. 2 B, C). Only Buds of intermediate stage did not express RXFP2 staining in Leydig cells. Nonactive Macaws and APs were conspicuous considering the lack of RXFP2-positive epididymal epithelium, whereas nonactive stages of Cocs had no RXFP2-expression in Leydig, and no expression in AGPs in germ cells.3.2.3.4. Relaxin-like factor A remarkable result was demonstrated in the analysis of RLF in Buds. This was the only species showing a correlation of positive stained cells for RLF and its receptor RXFP2 throughout all reproductive stages. Other species displayed this coherency merely in one stage (Cocs and AGPs in intermediate, APs in active stage). Another remarkable fact is that nonactive Cocs, AGPs, macaws, and APs expressed RLF in more different cell types than RXFP2. Figure 2 D, E represent the positive cytoplasmic reaction of RLF in spermatogonia of a nonactive Coc and in spermatocytes, Sertoli, and Leydig cells of an active macaw.3.2.4. Proliferation markers3.2.4.1. Ki67The proliferation marker Ki67 did not occur in nonactive macaws and Buds. On the contrary, a cross-species positive staining of germ cells was verifiable in intermediate and active stage ( Fig. 2 F, G). Most species (except the Bud) demonstrated Sertoli cell expression in the intermediate stage (AGP also in the nonactive stage). Referring to the type of positive stained cells, an explicit difference between active and nonactive stage was proven in macaws, APs, and Buds.3.2.4.2. Smooth muscle actin The SMA expression is demonstrated in Figure 2 H, I. Active and intermediate Cocs, AGPs, and macaws displayed SMA in germ cells and interductal connective tissue cells and in the testicular capsule, the peritubular tissue, and in blood vessels. In contrast, nonactive testes of the same species consistently had no positive germ cell staining. The remarkable findings in Buds were negatively-reacting germ and interductal connective tissue cells in the nonactive stage. The nonactive AP was the only parrot with actin-positive Sertoli cells.4. Discussion A large panel of antibodies was tested for the immunocytochemical analysis of testicular tissues from eight different psittacine genera to provide repeatable techniques for the support of breeding programs in captivity. As shown in mammals, histological and immunocytochemical investigations of testicular tissue are also reliable techniques to evaluate the sexual activity of budgerigars [3]. In the following paragraphs, we will discuss our results obtained for other psittacine species, sorted according to morphological and immunocytochemical aspects and always in comparison with our previous observations in the Bud.4.1. Histological criteria Reitemeier et al. [3] provided measurements of tubular and interstitial dimensions that define active, intermediate, and nonactive reproductive states of the Bud males. On the contrary, the other parrot species did not display significant differences within the three testicular stages. A conceivable reason for this finding might be species-specific variation in testis size based on different sperm competition, extrapair copulation behavior [44], breeding density, and clutch size [45]. We suggested that the enormous increase in testis size of the Bud during the breeding season (influenced by higher sperm competition because of colonial breeding, extrapair copulation behavior, and clutch size [44,45] ), especially in relation to the body mass, might be the reason for the significant differences in interstitial and seminiferous tubular dimensions. In contrast, testes of larger psittacines (solitarily breeders, strictly monogamous, smaller clutch size) do not enlarge that much during the breeding season, so the variation in seminiferous tubular volume and interstitial diameters might be less conspicuous. Hence, for psittacine species other than the Bud, the method of measuring tubular and interstitial dimensions is not reliable to characterize the reproductive status. All examined large Cocs ( Cacatua alba, Cacatua sulphurea sulphurea, Eolophus roseicapilla) presented melanocytes distributed in the testicular capsule and interstitium, a finding that is consistent with previous studies in various avian species [46–49]. Many of these reports discuss a correlation between testicular melanogenesis and gonadal regression. Marshall [47] suggested that the presence or absence of melanin was influenced by volumetric changes of the testes and the dispersion of melanocytes during the breeding season. The increased seminiferous tubules displace the melanocytes and the melanistic testis appears paler when reproductive activity begins. This matches closely with our observation that intermediate testes displayed less melanin than nonactive ones. Other authors hypothesize hormones of reproduction, such as FSH, LH, testosterone, and estrogen to have inhibitory effects on melanogenesis in the testis [46]. So it might be expected that gonads with melanin deposition show a downregulation of AR, ERα, and the activity of steroidogenic enzymes. However, we cannot support this view because nonactive and intermediate Cocs expressed the aforementioned hormone receptors and enzymes. Our detection of melanin accumulation in the nonactive testis of a macaw is in line with the observations of O’Malley [48]. Interestingly, melanin was not found either in testes of Nymphicus hollandicus, also a genus relative to Cacatuidae, or in the Buds, Amazon, or African gray parrots. Therefore, the testicular melanization seems to be species-specific, probably favored by natural selection in males of species with high mutation rates in the mitochondrial genome, as postulated by Galván et al. [50]. They also supposed that melanin protects male germ cells from oxidative stress, a fact that might be more important for large Cocs than for other parrot species.4.2. Immunocytochemical markers: applicability, cellular distribution, and species-specificity We were able to expand the repertory of markers for the immunocytochemical investigation of psittacine testes with the present study. This was achieved by the addition of further steroidogenic enzymes (aromatase, 17β-HSD-1 and -7), peptides of the RLN family (RLN, RXFP1 and 2, RLF) and the proliferation marker SMA to the spectrum established for the Bud [3]. Moreover, these markers were also tested on gonads of seven further psittacine genera to prove species-transferability of our methods. Their applicability concerning the assessment of the actual reproductive stage of a parrot species is depicted in Table 4. Table 4. Applicability of various markers for the immunocytochemical differentiation of active and nonactive gonads in male Psittaciformes.

Data on AR expression in avian testes are particularly conflicting. Most studies in poultry and canaries report restricted receptor localization on somatic cells [51,52]. This matches with our detection of AR in Leydig cells of Buds, African gray, and Amazon parrots, in Coc Sertoli cells and macaw smooth muscle cells (testicular capsule). So far, no correlating data exist for other avian species regarding AR-positive germ cells. Therefore, the regulation of spermatogenesis is supposed to be similar to that in mammals because androgens influence testicular somatic cells rather than act directly on germ cells [51]. Thanks to the expression of AR and androgen-synthesizing enzymes (HSDs) in germ cells ( Table 3 ), this study provides evidence about a direct influence of androgens on the germinal epithelium of parrots. The cellular-specific differences in AR-expression in the three reproductive stages indicate different sensitivity to androgens. The coexpression of ERα and aromatase in the avian male tract represents a novel finding. Other authors reported the detection of both, ERα and aromatase, in brain regions of passerines [53]. Every conducted parrot species displayed ERα and aromatase in germinal epithelium coinciding with the observations of Kwon et al. [5] in White Leghorn roosters. They postulated germ cells to be sites for estrogen synthesis because of strong aromatase immunostaining. As aforementioned for the Bud [3], this is still the first evidence of PR in gonads of male birds because so far, it has only been described in the reproductive tract of female birds, e.g., ostriches [54]. Similar to mammals, progesterone is supposed to be a stimulator of Leydig cell steroidogenesis. This could be confirmed by our results concerning PR expression in testicular Leydig cells and fibroblast-like Leydig cell precursors [55] in epididymis. The steroidogenic HSDs resulted as the most important group of markers for the definition of the reproductive status in male psittacines. 17β-HSD-2 offers an explicit differentiation between the active and nonactive stage in all examined species and 3β-HSD can also be used, except for in AGPs. The coexpression of 3β-HSD and AR (in germ, Leydig, and epididymal cells) and of 3β-HSD and PR (in germ cells) reflects the enzyme's function of catalyzing androstenedione and progesterone biosynthesis. This is the first report of 17β-HSD-2 in avian male gonads, so far known to be involved in neurosteroidogenesis of the avian brain [9]. Its expression in active and intermediate Sertoli and epididymal cells of all parrot species emphasizes its crucial role in testicular steroidogenesis. 17β-HSD-1 and -7 represent markers for estrogen-sensitive cells and tissues, so their presence in germ, somatic, and epididymal cells of every psittacine species underlines the remarkable effect of estrogens for the male reproductive tract. In addition, the coexistence of both, enzymes and ERα, in germinal epithelium and epididymis suggests a local production of estradiol. Our results regarding the expression of RLN and its receptor RXFP1 in Sertoli and Leydig cells match closely with their cellular distribution in the mammal testis [13,14]. The existence of RXFP1-positive germ cells in boars [14] coincides with our findings, whereas the presence of RLN in psittacine germ cells seems to be a novel observation. Concerning RLF and RXFP2, a Leydig cell expression was observed that is similar to that of mammals [15]. However, the peptide and its receptor were also detected in germ, Sertoli, and epididymal cells of the parrots, a fact that is not in accordance with the mammal situation. The fact that RLN, RLF, and their receptors are found in more different cell types of psittacine testes and epididymides in comparison with mammals can be explained as follows. Relaxin is the main product of human and rodent prostate epithelia [12], as is RLF, to a lesser extent [56]. The reproductive tract of male birds is characterized by the absence of accessory sexual glands. Lake [57] indicated that the avian intratesticular cells and epididymal epithelium function similarly to the mammal prostate. Expression of RLN, RLF, and their receptors would support Lake's statement. The function of RLN family in the avian male tract might be similar to mammals, having effects on somatic cell maturation, sperm motility, and fertilization [15]. It should be pointed out that the presence of the RLN family in avian species requires more investigation because our study, and the findings of RLN in the avian crop sac [19], ovary [58], and testes [17,18] are the only reports referring to this subject. The expression of Ki67 in Sertoli cells of psittacines is in line with observations in the domestic fowl [20]. The fact that germ cell proliferation declines in the nonactive stage of Buds and macaws is supported by Young and Nelson [59]. They postulated the rate of cell division to decrease in the testis of birds and rodents during regression, indirectly contributing to seasonal atrophy. The coexistence of ERα and Ki67 in psittacine germ cells indicates estrogens to stimulate mitosis, similar to mammals. Counting of Ki67-positive cells (see Reitemeier et al. [3]) to detect mitotic activity can be a conceivable method for all tested parrot species, except for APs. This might not only be performed for germ cells but also for Sertoli cells to determine testis size [60]. All of the conducted parrot species presented SMA-positive germ cells in testes of intermediate (except for the Bud) and active stage. These results reflect the actin expression found in elongating spermatids and spermatozoa of sexually mature and active galliform epididymides [61], although the authors did not report SMA expression in testicular germ cells. The fact that nonactive Cocs, AGPs, macaws, and Buds displayed negative germ cell staining could be applied for the definition of their reproductive activity. The detection of SMA in interductal connective tissue cells, testicular capsule, peritubular tissue, and blood vessels of the parrots matches closely with the previous findings in other bird orders [21]. Therefore, the main function of actin in psittacine testes is supposed to be the transport of testicular fluid through the various excurrent ducts because of the contractile ability of SMA-positive cells. Considering the results depicted in Table 3 and 4, it is obvious that the markers display different cell distribution patterns depending on the parrot species. Many reasons are conceivable for these species-specific variations in the expression of the tested markers, e.g., opportunistic species (Bud, cockatiel) breed when the conditions are most suitable, usually in arid areas after unpredictable rainfall [62]. In contrast to seasonal breeders (large Cocs, AGPs, APs, macaws), they might maintain their gonads in an advanced maturational stage so as to maximize reproductive effort in response to propitious environmental conditions. In addition, it is important to note that the birds live in different climate zones (tropical vs. subtropical species). Therefore, environmental factors, such as photostimulation, temperature, and humidity might also affect sexual activity, endocrine control, and subsequently, testicular function [63]. We also suppose that colonial versus territorial breeding has an influence on testicular cycles and endocrine control. Budgerigars are the only examined species considered as colonial breeders. In colonial breeders, the competition for nesting sites is more intense within the species which might result in differing levels of steroid hormones in opposition to territorial breeders. Tropical birds (like Cocs, macaws, or APs) often hold permanent feeding territories that cannot be defended by a single bird and apparent pair bonds might arise from the attachment to this territory [64]. This pair bonding plays a crucial role in dominance behavior which is, amongst other factors, influenced by androgens [65]. Therefore, the mating system can be considered as another important manipulating factor. As an example, cockatiels sometimes show extrapair copulation behavior [49] in comparison with perennial monogamy (which means year-round pair bonding, not only during breeding season and parental care) in Cocs [64] or long-term pair bonds in Amazons [66]. Extrapair copulation is accompanied by changes in dominance and mating behavior, probably resulting in different sensitivity of testicular cells to hormones or other factors. Additionally, pair mating depends on migration behavior, so variations might appear between sedentary [67] and irregular migrating birds [68]. In sedentary birds, mated pairs function as social alliances in resource competition. Most of all, especially with regard to RLN [12], evolutionary aspects might influence the species-specific cellular expression of the RLN family peptides and receptors. Within the scope of divergency of parrots, we hypothesize the development of different expression patterns.4.3. Conclusions In conclusion, we were able to detect 14 of the 15 tested markers in the testes of all investigated parrot species, even though they displayed partly heterogeneous, species-specific expression patterns. In general, 17β-HSD-2, 3β-HSD, and SMA allowed a precise definition of reproductive activity, whereas the other steroidogenic enzymes, steroid receptors, RLN peptides, and Ki67 turned out to be applicable depending on the species. The immunocytochemical methods established within the framework of our previous study in the Bud [3], were successfully adapted to other psittacines. It is important to note that different cellular distribution patterns do not allow a transfer of the results from one parrot species to another. Therefore, we recommend using a combination of markers, always in consideration of the investigated species. Our study delivers a reliable repertoire of sexual markers, an essential basis for further analyses, for instance, the peripheral detection of these factors in psittacine blood or feces.
