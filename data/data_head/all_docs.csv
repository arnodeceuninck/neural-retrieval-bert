31135,"Estrogen patch types Common Questions and Answers about Estrogen patch typesvivelle-dot I did not want to go through menopause or life with no estrogen at age 35, so I opted for the estrogen hormone therapy. I chose to go with the Estradiol patches. I think that it regulates the estrogen more efficiently and you can't forget to take a pill! Let me give you my two cents on your issues...know that I am not a dr., but am going through this myself. INSURANCE: The drug companies ALWAYS have programs to help those without insurance. Look it up on the internet and ask! !Read More I don't remember is you quoted an estrogen level or not. But, I do know they can go all types of things to boost your estrogen until your brain decides to do it on its on (your pituitary gland in your brain is what tells your body to produce estrogen). I believe it is easier to boost estrogen that progesterone. I am 8wks1dy PG and on my first beta, my HCG was 94 and my Progesterone was 17.4. Try not to stress out, because stress will affect your hormone levels. Read Moretestosterone (I use that too) was just okay but progesterone was hardly there at all. I decided to stay on the estrogen patch for the time being since I did not want to switch everything at once. My progesterone was increased and switched from cream to an oral form which I had to put under my tongue. Progesterone is a natural diuretic and in theory should not cause weight gain and in fact can promote weight loss when necessary (estrogen is cited as a weight ""maintainer""). Read More There have been a number of studies on estrogen and weight gain and estrogen is believed not to increase weight. Many women do gain weight and believe it is due to estrogen, but the studies don't support it. Some increase in breast size and some fluid retention do happen. Having your ovaries out can also affect your thyroid hormone levels and that can cause weight gain. Ask your doctor to check your thyroid levels. Machelle M. Read More Most types of bc increase your estrogen level in some way, pill, ring, patch, IUD, the shot, what have you they all change your hormone level but they all have their perks. If you don't mind taking a pill every night, you can find a low-dose bcp which has the lowest amount of estrogen in it. The ring, patch, IUD, and shot all have the advantages of convenience of which you only have to change once a month or 3-4 times a year but they do have higher amounts of estrogen. Read More I'm on the nuva ring for that reason. Estrogen gives me migraines and with the pill and the patch I had too many. The patch has the highest dose of hormones. Read More After a woman stops BC, especially the patch sense it puts 60% more estrogen into your blood, it is my theory that a woman may be more quickly primed for ovulation... Just my thoughts, I'll let you all opine. 3) I know it will come down to this eventually so please let me know if this will be a satisfactory method. They are both O- blood types. I understand that two O-'s can only produce an O-. I am not O-. Read More Hopefully, your doctor will work with you to try out some other types of estrogen. And some women find that taking testosterone helps too. But it is best to get settled on estrogen before adding any other hormones. I hope this helps! Let us know how you are doing as you tweak things. Read More My doctor informed me that Incivek (Telaprevir) blokes the hormone Estrogen, yikes, this could get ugly. I use a cream that I apply daily. I made an appointment with ND to see what we can do and start tx in September. Has anyone been experiencing symptoms of lack of Estrogen? It might get difficult to seperate it all. Thanks............... Read More I'm getitng a little impatient and will call to schedule on my own. I'm using an estrogen patch. Wonder if I should continue? The gyn-onc should advise me, I think. Read More Maybe Premarin is not a good fit for you since you still have (insane) hot flashes. Have you tried any other types of estrogen such as a gel, patch, or the estradiol tablet (generic Estrace)? I had to switch HRT's because the first one I was prescribed left me with too many low E symptoms. Read More I too had urinary symptoms, was tested for 3 UTI's that I didn't have, and was placed on a higher dose of estrogen. I use the vivelle dot patch, oral estrogen and vaginal estrogen. This seems to have helped the urinary problems amongst other things. Are you on hormone replacement? There is a great book I am reading called ""Screaming to be heard"" by Elizabeth Vliet MD and it really goes into detail on how hormones affect every organ system. Are you on Hormone replacement? Read More I don't know of any study for women in surgical menopause at a young age and that is frustrating!! For now, I have decided to stay on the estrogen patch and I'll talk more with my doctor in March. I know how I felt when the dose was too low for me and it was no way to live. My husband and small children don't deserve it. I was miserable and they knew it. I guess it might be a risk but I also feel that there is no way to know for sure if taking the hormone will cause cancer. Read Morepills are those that have the lowest amount of estrogen in a birth control pill or 20 mcg (0.02 milligrams or mg). The 20 mcg estrogen dose is sufficient for contraception, but pills with this so-called ultra low estrogen dose of 20 mcg are associated with more spotting and breakthrough bleeding than pills containing 30 or 35 mcg of estrogen. There are no ultra low dose triphasic pills. There is also one birth control pill that contains NO estrogen (Micronor contains 0. Read More The last time I tried HRT I tried a couple of different types, So far this time I have only tried one type for two weeks. The doctor doubled the dose on Friday because it wasn't working, However, I feel so awful I have not taken any tonight. I just want it to stop. I thought HRT was supposed to stop these symptoms not make them worse? Please help. Read More I have been on estradiol .1mg transdermal patch and 100mg of progesterone for a little bit over a month now. I have been bleeding for a month from it and just recently (past 2 weeks) developed severe headaches that do not go away what so ever. I went to my obgyn the other day and he lowered my estradiol to .075mg and upped my progesterone to 200mg for month to stop the bleeding. He told me the headaches are not due to the medication...does anyone else experience headaches on HRT?? Read More But, to answer your question, for me since I had a radical hysterectomy, it is hard to gauge how quickly the estrogen kicked in, but I imagine it did right away as my oncologist put it on me (it was a patch, the Vivelle patch, a bioidentical estrogen that I could pick up at any local pharmacy) so I never did have a hot flash. But, I ended up in estrogen dominance...and it was because of that that I started to research this stuff and find out what it was that was missing. Read More The P450 system helps process both of the hormones in the pill, the patch, and the ring— estrogen and progestin. Some medicines speed up or slow down this enzyme system. If the system is revved up, it will go to work breaking down and removing the hormones faster than normal, resulting in lower levels of the hormones to get the job done. It can result in such low levels of hormone that the pill, patch, or ring don’t work. What if I take a medication that messes with hormonal birth control? Read More If your doctor advises you to take an anti estrogen medication,please be aware that Hormone Replacement Therapy and Tamoxifen are contraindicated ,because HRT (Estrogen) is a female hormone that can fuel the growth of cancerous cells,while Tamoxifen blocks the actions of estrogen and is used to treat and prevent some types of pre-cancer condition or breast cancer. I am sure your Oncologist would be your best source of information regarding treatments. All the best to you... Read More I have an issue that has made itself a very detrimental part of my life. I believe getting your opinion on this would help me cope with the situation. The Facts: 1) My girlfriend is pregnant. 2) First day of last menstrual period: 4/27/07 (also the day she stopped birth control) 3) This cycle was her first cycle on the patch, previous to that she had been on the pill. 4) We were very sexually active from 4/27-4/12.

Read More I will comment and hope in some way it helps as you research this issue. It is certainly a very confusing one. It is and has been an issue for me. I had to see a Urologist in 1998 because I was going crazy having to urinate what seemed like all the time. For me, I would go...and, then like a minute later, I would go again, and often, a minute after that, more ""going."" Now, having said that, I am known notoriously in my family as the one with bladder issues. Read More But, then I started to mess around with my estrogen (adding other types of estrogen, too... mistake for me) and adding progesterone (on a very high dose based on one school of thought...again, mistake for me)... Now I use the Vivelle patch and I am trying to get my blood levels to around 100 - 110 ng/ml (hope I wrote that right).... although I have heard that it should be around 100 at a MINIMUM. So, I go by symptoms as well as blood levels. Optimal dose is key here. Read More From reading posts here, cysts seem to be growing at all different rates, but I am not sure about the types. I am sure someone who is in a similar situation can answer you better. I still don't know what type mine were yet or I could help more. Just read through old posts, somebody's will catch your attn, then drop them a note. Good luck and welcome!Read Morehot flashes were the worst... I have been on a small low dose of estrogenpatch ..it has helped me tremendously... My worst symptoms were hot flashes and mood swings other than that I have been ok.. My doctor recommended the patch because they felt I was too young to put my body through menopause.. I also was diagnosed with severe endometriosis and my ca-125 was 44. Good Luck and Keep us posted.... Read More Once I started to feel the loss of progesterone and testosterone (I was given estrogen in a bio patch) I knew I was in trouble. In the case of your friend she may not have these issues since again, if her ovaries are intact...she should be fine regarding hormones. I know I am skipping around...this is not a small topic.

But, my oncologist started me on Vivelle estrogen patch (a bioidentical product)but that was it. Now, I am grateful that she did not start me on what we all think of when we hear of HRT. I don't consider myself on HRT... But, bioidentical hormones have saved my life. Read More I have an issue that has made itself a very detrimental part of my life.

Read More Then late Saturday afternoon a nurse came in and threw a hormone patch onto my back because my dr. decided to give me a jump start on hormone meds to fend off any issues. I was a little annoyed because I had discussed with my dr. to do bio-dential hormones and to not start anything right after surgery. So I am not sue what happened and why I got a Climera patch when I did not want one. I was so out of it that I just went with it and did not argue, because my dr. was not on call.

This article is part of a series on the Politics of the United States of America Federal Government [show]Legislature [show]Executive [show]Judiciary [show]Elections [show]Political parties [show]Federalism [show]Other countries Atlasv t e The Federal Government of the United States ( U. S. Federal Government) is the national government of the United States, a republic in North America, composed of 50 states, one district, Washington, D. C. (the nation's capital), and several territories. The federal government is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive, and judicial, whose powers are vested by the U. S. Constitution in the Congress, the president, and the federal courts, respectively. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court.

No other name appears in the Constitution, and this is the name that appears on money, in treaties, and in legal cases to which it is a party ( Charles T. Schenck v. United States ). The terms ""Government of the United States of America"" or ""United States Government"" are often used in official documents to represent the federal government as distinct from the states collectively. In casual conversation or writing, the term ""Federal Government"" is often used, and the term ""National Government"" is sometimes used. The terms ""Federal"" and ""National"" in government agency or program names generally indicate affiliation with the federal government ( Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Park Service ). Because the seat of government is in Washington, D. C., ""Washington"" is commonly used as a metonym for the federal government. History The outline of the government of the United States is laid out in the Constitution. The government was formed in 1789, when the Constitution went into effect, making the United States one of the world's first, if not the first, modern national constitutional republics. [1]The United States government is based on the principles of federalism and republicanism, in which power is shared between the federal government and state governments. The interpretation and execution of these principles, including what powers the federal government should have and how those powers can be exercised, have been debated ever since the adoption of the Constitution. Some make the case for expansive federal powers while others argue for a more limited role for the central government in relation to individuals, the states, or other recognized entities. Since the American Civil War, the powers of the federal government have generally expanded greatly, although there have been periods since that time of legislative branch dominance (e.g., the decades immediately following the Civil War) or when states' rights proponents have succeeded in limiting federal power through legislative action, executive prerogative or by constitutional interpretation by the courts. [2] [3]One of the theoretical pillars of the U. S. Constitution is the idea of "" checks and balances "" among the powers and responsibilities of the three branches of American government: the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary. For example, while the legislative branch ( Congress) has the power to create law, the executive branch under the president can veto any legislation—an act which, in turn, can be overridden by Congress. [4] The president nominates judges to the nation's highest judiciary authority, the Supreme Court, but those nominees must be approved by Congress. The Supreme Court, in turn, can invalidate unconstitutional laws passed by the Congress. These and other examples are examined in more detail in the text below. Legislative branch Main article: United States Congress Seal of the U. S. Congress The United States Congress is the legislative branch of the federal government. It is bicameral, comprising the House of Representatives and the Senate. Makeup of Congress House of Representatives The 435 seats of the House grouped by state The House currently consists of 435 voting members, each of whom represents a congressional district. The number of representatives each state has in the House is based on each state's population as determined in the most recent United States Census. All 435 representatives serve a two-year term. Each state receives a minimum of one representative in the House. In order to be elected as a representative, an individual must be at least 25 years of age, must have been a U. S. citizen for at least seven years, and must live in the state that he or she represents. There is no limit on the number of terms a representative may serve. In addition to the 435 voting members, there are 6 non-voting members, consisting of 5 delegates and one resident commissioner. There is one delegate each from the District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the resident commissioner from Puerto Rico. [5]Senate In contrast, the Senate is made up of two senators from each state, regardless of population. There are currently 100 senators (2 from each of the 50 states), who each serve six-year terms. Approximately one-third of the Senate stands for election every two years. Different powers The House and Senate each have particular exclusive powers. For example, the Senate must approve (give "" advice and consent "" to) many important presidential appointments, including cabinet officers, federal judges (including nominees to the Supreme Court), department secretaries (heads of federal executive branch departments), U. S. military and naval officers, and ambassadors to foreign countries. All legislative bills for raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives. The approval of both chambers is required to pass all legislation, which then may only become law by being signed by the president (or, if the president vetoes the bill, both houses of Congress then re-pass the bill, but by a two-thirds majority of each chamber, in which case the bill becomes law without the president's signature). The powers of Congress are limited to those enumerated in the Constitution; all other powers are reserved to the states and the people. The Constitution also includes the "" Necessary and Proper Clause "", which grants Congress the power to ""make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers"". Members of the House and Senate are elected by first-past-the-post voting in every state except Louisiana and Georgia, which have runoffs. Impeachment of federal officers Main article: Impeachment in the United States Congress has the power to remove the president, federal judges, and other federal officers from office. The House of Representatives and Senate have separate roles in this process. The House must first vote to ""impeach"" the official. Then, a trial is held in the Senate to decide whether the official should be removed from office. Although two presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives ( Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton ), neither of them was removed following trial in the Senate. Congressional procedures Article I, Section 2, paragraph 2 of the U. S. Constitution gives each chamber the power to ""determine the rules of its proceedings"". From this provision were created congressional committees, which do the work of drafting legislation and conducting congressional investigations into national matters. The 108th Congress (2003–2005) had 19 standing committees in the House and 17 in the Senate, plus 4 joint permanent committees with members from both houses overseeing the Library of Congress, printing, taxation, and the economy. In addition, each house may name special, or select, committees to study specific problems. Today, much of the congressional workload is borne by the subcommittees, of which there are around 150. Powers of Congress Main article: Article One of the United States Constitution The United States Capitol is the seat of government for Congress. The Constitution grants numerous powers to Congress. Enumerated in Article I, Section 8, these include the powers to levy and collect taxes; to coin money and regulate its value; provide for punishment for counterfeiting; establish post offices and roads, issue patents, create federal courts inferior to the Supreme Court, combat piracies and felonies, declare war, raise and support armies, provide and maintain a navy, make rules for the regulation of land and naval forces, provide for, arm and discipline the militia, exercise exclusive legislation in the District of Columbia, and to make laws necessary to properly execute powers. Over the two centuries since the United States was formed, many disputes have arisen over the limits on the powers of the federal government. These disputes have often been the subject of lawsuits that have ultimately been decided by the United States Supreme Court. Congressional oversight Main article: Congressional oversight Congressional oversight is intended to prevent waste and fraud, protect civil liberties and individual rights, ensure executive compliance with the law, gather information for making laws and educating the public, and evaluate executive performance. [6]It applies to cabinet departments, executive agencies, regulatory commissions, and the presidency. Congress's oversight function takes many forms: Committee inquiries and hearings Formal consultations with and reports from the president Senate advice and consent for presidential nominations and for treaties House impeachment proceedings and subsequent Senate trials House and Senate proceedings under the 25th Amendment in the event that the president becomes disabled or the office of the vice president falls vacant Informal meetings between legislators and executive officials Congressional membership: each state is allocated a number of seats based on its representation (or ostensible representation, in the case of D. C.) in the House of Representatives. Each state is allocated two senators regardless of its population. As of January 2010, the District of Columbia elects a non-voting representative to the House of Representatives along with American Samoa, the U. S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Executive branch See also: Article Two of the United States Constitution and List of United States federal executive orders The executive power in the federal government is vested in the President of the United States, [7] although power is often delegated to the Cabinet members and other officials. [8] [9] The president and vice president are elected as running mates by the Electoral College, for which each state, as well as the District of Columbia, is allocated a number of seats based on its representation (or ostensible representation, in the case of D. C.) in both houses of Congress. [7] [10] The president is limited to a maximum of two four-year terms. [11] If the president has already served two years or more of a term to which some other person was elected, he or she may only serve one more additional four-year term. [7]President Main article: President of the United States Seal of the President of the United States The executive branch consists of the president and those to whom the president's powers are delegated. The president is both the head of state and government, as well as the military commander-in-chief and chief diplomat. The president, according to the Constitution, must ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed"", and ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution"". The president presides over the executive branch of the federal government, an organization numbering about 5 million people, including 1 million active-duty military personnel and 600,000 postal service employees. The president may sign legislation passed by Congress into law or may veto it, preventing it from becoming law unless two-thirds of both houses of Congress vote to override the veto. The president may unilaterally sign treaties with foreign nations. However, ratification of international treaties requires a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. The president may be impeached by a majority in the House and removed from office by a two-thirds majority in the Senate for "" treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors "". The president may not dissolve Congress or call special elections but does have the power to pardon or release criminals convicted of offenses against the federal government (except in cases of impeachment), enact executive orders, and (with the consent of the Senate) appoint Supreme Court justices and federal judges. Vice president Main article: Vice President of the United States Seal of the Vice President of the United States The vice president is the second-highest official in rank of the federal government. The office of the vice president's duties and powers are established in the legislative branch of the federal government under Article 1, Section 3, Clauses 4 and 5 as the President of the Senate; this means that he or she is the head of the Senate. In that capacity, the vice president is allowed to vote in the Senate, but only when necessary to break a tie vote. Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College. As first in the U. S. presidential line of succession, the vice president's duties and powers move to the executive branch when becoming president upon the death, resignation, or removal of the president, which has happened nine times in U. S. history. Lastly, in the case of a Twenty-fifth Amendment succession event, the vice president would become acting president, assuming all of the powers and duties of president, except being designated as president. Accordingly, by circumstances, the Constitution designates the vice president as routinely in the legislative branch, or succeeding to the executive branch as president, or possibly being in both as acting president pursuant to the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Because of circumstances, the overlapping nature of the duties and powers attributed to the office, the title of the office and other matters, such has generated a spirited scholarly dispute regarding attaching an exclusive branch designation to the office of vice president. [12] [13]Cabinet, executive departments, and agencies Main articles: Cabinet of the United States, United States federal executive departments, and List of federal agencies in the United States The day-to-day enforcement and administration of federal laws is in the hands of the various federal executive departments, created by Congress to deal with specific areas of national and international affairs. The heads of the 15 departments, chosen by the president and approved with the ""advice and consent"" of the U. S. Senate, form a council of advisers generally known as the president's ""Cabinet"". Once confirmed, these ""cabinet officers"" serve at the pleasure of the president. In addition to departments, a number of staff organizations are grouped into the Executive Office of the President. These include the White House staff, the National Security Council, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of the U. S. Trade Representative, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The employees in these United States government agencies are called federal civil servants. There are also independent agencies such as the United States Postal Service (USPS), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In addition, there are government-owned corporations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation. Judicial branch Main articles: Federal judiciary of the United States and United States federal courts See also: Article Three of the United States Constitution The Judiciary explains and applies the laws. This branch does this by hearing and eventually making decisions on various legal cases. Overview of the federal judiciary Seal of the U. S. Supreme Court Article III section I of the Constitution establishes the Supreme Court of the United States and authorizes the United States Congress to establish inferior courts as their need shall arise. Section I also establishes a lifetime tenure for all federal judges and states that their compensation may not be diminished during their time in office. Article II section II establishes that all federal judges are to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the United States Senate. The Judiciary Act of 1789 subdivided the nation jurisdictionally into judicial districts and created federal courts for each district. The three tiered structure of this act established the basic structure of the national judiciary: the Supreme Court, 13 courts of appeals, 94 district courts, and two courts of special jurisdiction. Congress retains the power to re-organize or even abolish federal courts lower than the Supreme Court. The U. S. Supreme Court adjudicates "" cases and controversies ""—matters pertaining to the federal government, disputes between states, and interpretation of the United States Constitution, and, in general, can declare legislation or executive action made at any level of the government as unconstitutional, nullifying the law and creating precedent for future law and decisions. The United States Constitution does not specifically mention the power of judicial review (the power to declare a law unconstitutional). The power of judicial review was asserted by Chief Justice Marshall in the landmark Supreme Court Case Marbury v. Madison (1803). There have been instances in the past where such declarations have been ignored by the other two branches. Below the U. S. Supreme Court are the United States Courts of Appeals, and below them in turn are the United States District Courts, which are the general trial courts for federal law, and for certain controversies between litigants who are not deemed citizens of the same state ("" diversity jurisdiction ""). There are three levels of federal courts with general jurisdiction, meaning that these courts handle criminal cases and civil lawsuits between individuals. Other courts, such as the bankruptcy courts and the Tax Court, are specialized courts handling only certain kinds of cases ("" subject matter jurisdiction ""). The Bankruptcy Courts are ""under"" the supervision of the district courts, and, as such, are not considered part of the "" Article III "" judiciary and also as such their judges do not have lifetime tenure, nor are they Constitutionally exempt from diminution of their remuneration. [14] Also the Tax Court is not an Article III court (but is, instead an ""Article I Court""). [15]The district courts are the trial courts wherein cases that are considered under the Judicial Code (Title 28, United States Code) consistent with the jurisdictional precepts of "" federal question jurisdiction "" and ""diversity jurisdiction"" and "" pendent jurisdiction "" can be filed and decided. The district courts can also hear cases under "" removal jurisdiction "", wherein a case brought in State court meets the requirements for diversity jurisdiction, and one party litigant chooses to ""remove"" the case from state court to federal court. The United States Courts of Appeals are appellate courts that hear appeals of cases decided by the district courts, and some direct appeals from administrative agencies, and some interlocutory appeals. The U. S. Supreme Court hears appeals from the decisions of the courts of appeals or state supreme courts, and in addition has original jurisdiction over a few cases. The judicial power extends to cases arising under the Constitution, an Act of Congress; a U. S. treaty; cases affecting ambassadors, ministers and consuls of foreign countries in the U. S.; cases and controversies to which the federal government is a party; controversies between states (or their citizens) and foreign nations (or their citizens or subjects); and bankruptcy cases (collectively ""federal-question jurisdiction""). The Eleventh Amendment removed from federal jurisdiction cases in which citizens of one state were the plaintiffs and the government of another state was the defendant. It did not disturb federal jurisdiction in cases in which a state government is a plaintiff and a citizen of another state the defendant. The power of the federal courts extends both to civil actions for damages and other redress, and to criminal cases arising under federal law. The interplay of the Supremacy Clause and Article III has resulted in a complex set of relationships between state and federal courts. Federal courts can sometimes hear cases arising under state law pursuant to diversity jurisdiction, state courts can decide certain matters involving federal law, and a handful of federal claims are primarily reserved by federal statute to the state courts (for example, those arising from the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 ). Both court systems thus can be said to have exclusive jurisdiction in some areas and concurrent jurisdiction in others. The U. S. Constitution safeguards judicial independence by providing that federal judges shall hold office ""during good behavior""; in practice, this usually means they serve until they die, retire, or resign. A judge who commits an offense while in office may be impeached in the same way as the president or other officials of the federal government. U. S. judges are appointed by the president, subject to confirmation by the Senate. Another Constitutional provision prohibits Congress from reducing the pay of any Article III judge (Congress is able to set a lower salary for all future judges that take office after the reduction, but may not decrease the rate of pay for judges already in office). Relationships between state and federal courts Separate from, but not entirely independent of, this federal court system are the court systems of each state, each dealing with, in addition to federal law when not deemed preempted, a state's own laws, and having its own court rules and procedures. Although state governments and the federal government are legally dual sovereigns, the Supreme Court of the United States is in many cases the appellate court from the State Supreme Courts (e.g., absent the Court countenancing the applicability of the doctrine of adequate and independent State grounds ). The Supreme Courts of each state are by this doctrine the final authority on the interpretation of the applicable state's laws and Constitution. Many state constitution provisions are equal in breadth to those of the U. S. Constitution, but are considered ""parallel"" (thus, where, for example, the right to privacy pursuant to a state constitution is broader than the federal right to privacy, and the asserted ground is explicitly held to be ""independent"", the question can be finally decided in a State Supreme Court—the U. S. Supreme Court will decline to take jurisdiction). A State Supreme Court, other than of its own accord, is bound only by the U. S. Supreme Court's interpretation of federal law, but is not bound by interpretation of federal law by the federal court of appeals for the federal circuit in which the state is included, or even the federal district courts located in the state, a result of the dual sovereigns concept. Conversely, a federal district court hearing a matter involving only a question of state law (usually through diversity jurisdiction) must apply the substantive law of the state in which the court sits, a result of the application of the Erie Doctrine; however, at the same time, the case is heard under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence instead of state procedural rules (that is, the application of the Erie Doctrine only extends to a requirement that a federal court asserting diversity jurisdiction apply substantive state law, but not procedural state law, which may be different). Together, the laws of the federal and state governments form U. S. law. Elections and voting Main article: Elections in the United States Diagram of the Federal Government and American Union, 1862. Suffrage, commonly known as the ability to vote, has changed significantly over time. In the early years of the United States, voting was considered a matter for state governments, and was commonly restricted to white men who owned land. Direct elections were mostly held only for the U. S. House of Representatives and state legislatures, although what specific bodies were elected by the electorate varied from state to state. Under this original system, both senators representing each state in the U. S. Senate were chosen by a majority vote of the state legislature. Since the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, members of both houses of Congress have been directly elected. Today, U. S. citizens have almost universal suffrage under equal protection of the laws [16] from the age of 18, [17] regardless of race, [18] gender, [19] or wealth. [20] The only significant exception to this is the disenfranchisement of convicted felons, and in some states former felons as well. Under the U. S. Constitution, the national representation of U. S. territories and the federal district of Washington, D. C. in Congress is limited: while residents of the District of Columbia are subject to federal laws and federal taxes, their only congressional representative is a non-voting delegate; however, they have been allowed to participate in presidential elections since March 29, 1961. [21] Residents of U. S. territories have varying rights; for example, only some residents of Puerto Rico pay federal income taxes (though all residents must pay all other federal taxes, including import/export taxes, federal commodity taxes and federal payroll taxes, including Social Security and Medicare ). All federal laws that are ""not locally inapplicable"" are automatically the law of the land in Puerto Rico but their current representation in the U. S. Congress is in the form of a Resident Commissioner, a nonvoting delegate. [22]State, tribal, and local governments Main articles: State governments of the United States, Tribal sovereignty in the United States, and Local government in the United States The states of the United States as divided into counties (or, in Louisiana and Alaska, parishes and boroughs, respectively). Alaska and Hawaii are not to scale and the Aleutian and uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands have been omitted. The state governments tend to have the greatest influence over most Americans' daily lives. The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from exercising any power not delegated to it by the States in the Constitution; as a result, states handle the majority of issues most relevant to individuals within their jurisdiction. Because state governments are not authorized to print currency, they generally have to raise revenue through either taxes or bonds. As a result, state governments tend to impose severe budget cuts or raise taxes any time the economy is faltering. [23]Each state has its own written constitution, government and code of laws. The Constitution stipulates only that each state must have, ""a Republican Government"". Therefore, there are often great differences in law and procedure between individual states, concerning issues such as property, crime, health and education, amongst others. The highest elected official of each state is the Governor. Each state also has an elected state legislature ( bicameralism is a feature of every state except Nebraska ), whose members represent the voters of the state. Each state maintains its own state court system. In some states, supreme and lower court justices are elected by the people; in others, they are appointed, as they are in the federal system. As a result of the Supreme Court case Worcester v. Georgia, American Indian tribes are considered ""domestic dependent nations"" that operate as sovereign governments subject to federal authority but, in some cases, outside of the jurisdiction of state governments. Hundreds of laws, executive orders and court cases have modified the governmental status of tribes vis-à-vis individual states, but the two have continued to be recognized as separate bodies. Tribal governments vary in robustness, from a simple council used to manage all aspects of tribal affairs, to large and complex bureaucracies with several branches of government. Tribes are currently encouraged to form their own governments, with power resting in elected tribal councils, elected tribal chairpersons, or religiously appointed leaders (as is the case with pueblos ). Tribal citizenship and voting rights are typically restricted to individuals of native descent, but tribes are free to set whatever citizenship requirements they wish. The institutions that are responsible for local government within states are typically town, city, or county boards, water management districts, fire management districts, library districts and other similar governmental units which make laws that affect their particular area. These laws concern issues such as traffic, the sale of alcohol and the keeping of animals. The highest elected official of a town or city is usually the mayor. In New England, towns operate in a direct democratic fashion, and in some states, such as Rhode Island, Connecticut, and some parts of Massachusetts, counties have little or no power, existing only as geographic distinctions. In other areas, county governments have more power, such as to collect taxes and maintain law enforcement agencies.

S. (See Page 9, line 1. ), and some others (For example, Puerto Rican residents that are members of the U. S. military, See Heritage.org and Puerto Rico residents who earned income from sources outside Puerto Rico, See pp 14–15.) also pay federal income taxes. In addition, because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the U. S. IRS code, and because the per-capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per-capita income on the mainland, more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island. This occurs because ""the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U. S. State and local governments"" (See GAO.gov). As residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security, Puerto Ricans are eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement, but are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) (Commonwealth of Puerto Rico residents, unlike residents of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and residents of the 50 States, do not receive the SSI. See Socialsecurity.gov), and the island actually receives less than 15% of the Medicaid funding it would normally receive if it were a U. S. state. However, Medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico, even though the latter paid fully into the system (See p. 252). Archived May 11, 2011, at the Wayback Machine. It has also been estimated (See Eagleforum.org that, because the population of the island is greater than that of 50% of the states, if it were a state, Puerto Rico would have six to eight seats in the House, in addition to the two seats in the Senate.

Another misconception is that the import/export taxes collected by the U. S. on products manufactured in Puerto Rico are all returned to the Puerto Rico Treasury. This is not the case. Such import/export taxes are returned only for rum products, and even then the US Treasury keeps a portion of those taxes (See the ""House Report 110-597 – Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2007 "" mentioned above. )^ ""A brief overview of state fiscal conditions and the effects of federal policies on state budgets"" (PDF).
