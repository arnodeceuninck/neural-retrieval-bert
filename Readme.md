# neural-retrieval-bert
I've chosen the second project: Neural retrieval model - Document ranking.

# Tutorials
To get started, I read the tutorials that were mentioned in the assignment. The extra documentation for this can be found in `tutorials.ipynb`.
Next, I took a look at the SBERT documentation. The extra documentation for this can be found in `sbert-doc.ipynb`. Here can also most of the code be found.
Finally, after all those tutorials, I did some additional experiments. They are described in `experiments.ipynb`.
